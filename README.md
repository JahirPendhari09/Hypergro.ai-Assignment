## Technologies Used
### 1. TypeScript 
This project is developed using TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. TypeScript offers several benefits, including:

<li> Type Safety:- TypeScript provides compile-time type checking, helping catch errors and bugs early in the development process.</li>
<li>Enhanced IDE Support:-IDEs and text editors with TypeScript support offer advanced features like code completion, refactoring tools, and type information tooltips.Improved Code Maintainability: With explicit type annotations, code becomes more self-documenting and easier to understand, reducing the likelihood of introducing errors during maintenance.</li>
<li>Better Collaboration:-TypeScript's type system helps clarify interfaces and function signatures, facilitating collaboration among team members.</li>
<li>Ecosystem Compatibility:- TypeScript seamlessly integrates with existing JavaScript libraries and frameworks, allowing gradual adoption in projects.</li>
         
### 2. React

React is a JavaScript library for building Ssamless UI. Its component-based architecture makes it easy to manage and organize UI elements, promoting reusability and maintainability.React Provide SOC ( Seperation of Concerns ) so we can separate our app.

### 3. Axios

Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for making asynchronous requests in JavaScript. It simplifies data fetching and handling HTTP responses, making it a reliable choice for API interactions in React applications.
